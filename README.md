Installation
------------
```
git clone https://github.com/ICIdsl/pytorch_training.git\
cd pytorch_training\
git submodule update --init src/muppet 
```

The following section defines MuPPET specific config file parameters. 
config.ini
----------
> MuPPET\_Hyperparameters
- **Run\_Muppet** : If False, all following parameters are ignored and regular training is performed 
- **Bit\_Width** : Bitwidth at which MuPPET training begins. If FP32, set to -1 
- **Data\_Type** : One of "DFixed" or "Float". Has to match **Bit\_Width** specified
- **Round\_Meth** : One of "Simple" or "Stochastic"
- **Policy\_Resolution** : Refer to resolution hyperparameter in associated paper  
- **Policy\_Patience** : Refer to patience hyperparameter in associated paper
- **Fp32\_Epochs\_Per\_Lr** : Number of epochs run at each learning rate once in FP32 training  
- **Prec\_Schedule** : Precisions to change into at each switch. First precision must match with the value for **Bit\_Width**
